🧵 Add Threads embedding to a WordPress post.

== Description ==

A temporary plugin solution to embedding Threads into a WordPress post, until such time that they provide an API.

Once the plugin is installed and activated...

* Head to your Thread conversation and click on the share option under it
* Select "Copy link"
* You should be able to paste that link straight into a post and it will appear as an embed

There are no additional parameters that you can specify, and the embed appears as specified by Meta.

**Please Note:**
This plugin makes use of an external, third-party script, provided my Threads (part of Meta), which allows a Threads post to be displayed in its original format. Their privacy policy can be [found here](https://help.instagram.com/515230437301944).

== Installation ==

Embed Threads can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration (Plugins -> Add New). Alternatively, it can be downloaded from WordPress.org and installed manually...

1. Upload the entire `social-post-embed` folder to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress administration.

It's now ready to go and there are no settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
