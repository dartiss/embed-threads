ðŸ§µ dd Threads embedding to a WordPress post.

== Description ==

A temporary plugin solution to embedding Threads into a WordPress post, until such time that they provide an API.

Once the plugin is installed and activated...

* Head to your Thread conversation and click on the share option under it
* Select "Copy link"
* You should be able to paste that link straight into a post and it will appear as an embed

There are no additional parameters that you can specify, and the embed appears as specified by Meta.

== Installation ==

Embed Threads can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration (Plugins -> Add New). Alternatively, it can be downloaded from WordPress.org and installed manually...

1. Upload the entire `solo-search` folder to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress administration.

It's now ready to go and there are no settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Embeds are not appearing - it keeps showing "Cannot embed' =

A number of plugins which make use of JavaScript appear to conflict with Meta's code. Known plugins so far include Query Monitor and Tada.

== Changelog ==

I use semantic versioning, with the first release being 1.0.

* Enhancement: After finding that the embeds didn't work on my personal site, I realised that some of the embed code that I removed was a fallback mechanism. I've now added it back whilst I try and work out why this is occurring

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.0 =
* Fallback output added for when the embed can't be displayed
