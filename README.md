# Social Post Embed

<img src="https://ps.w.org/social-post-embed/assets/icon-128x128.png" align="left">üßµ WordPress plugin to add embedding of Threads to the editor.

A temporary plugin solution to embedding Threads into a WordPress post, until such time that they provide an API.

Once the plugin is installed and activated...

* Head to your Thread conversation and click on the share option under it
* Select "Copy link"
* You should be able to paste that link straight into a post and it will appear as an embed

There are no additional parameters that you can specify, and the embed appears as specified by Meta.
