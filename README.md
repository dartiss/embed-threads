# Social Post Embed

<img src="https://ps.w.org/social-post-embed/assets/icon-128x128.png" align="left">üìå WordPress plugin to add embedding for various social media platforms to your posts.

A temporary plugin solution to add embedding of various social media platform posts, until such time that they become of WordPress Core. At this moment this plugin will support embedding of Threads and Spoutible posts.

Using the plugin is incredibly simple. Once it's installed and activated...

* Head to your social media conversation and click on the option to copy a link to it (or just grab the URL from the browser)
* You should be able to paste that link straight into a post and it will appear as an embed

There are no additional parameters that you can specify, and the embed appears as specified by their originating sites.
