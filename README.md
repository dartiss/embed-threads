# Threads Embed

<img src="https://artiss.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/icon-128x128-1.png" align="left">üßµ WordPress plugin to add embedding of Threads to the editor.

A temporary plugin solution to embedding Threads into a WordPress post, until such time that they provide an API.

Once the plugin is installed and activated...

* Head to your Thread conversation and click on the share option under it
* Select "Copy link"
* You should be able to paste that link straight into a post and it will appear as an embed

There are no additional parameters that you can specify, and the embed appears as specified by Meta.
